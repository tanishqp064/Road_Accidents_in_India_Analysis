**Accident Prediction in India**

**ðŸ“ŠProject Overview**

Road accidents are a significant concern globally, leading to fatalities, injuries, and economic losses. Understanding the factors contributing to accidents is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies. 

This project aims to:

- Explore the characteristics of road accidents in India.
- Analyze accident severity and contributing factors. 
- Identify high-risk demographics, locations, and conditions.

**ðŸ§° Technologies & Tools**
- Python 3.x
- Pandas for data manipulation 
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization 
- Scikit-learn for machine learning (Linear Regression) 
- SciPy for statistical analysis (T-test)

**ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings**

Some of the insights derived from this analysis include:

- Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of reported accidents. 
- Wet and under-construction road conditions are associated with the highest fatality rates. 
- Peak accident times are between 5â€“8 AM and 6â€“9 PM. 
- Drivers aged 20â€“35 are most frequently involved in accidents. 
- Alcohol involvement noticeably increases accident severity. 
- Accidents with more vehicles and higher speeds tend to result in more casualties.
